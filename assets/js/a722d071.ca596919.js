Unlike traditional programming, where logic and rules are explicitly coded by humans, machine learning algorithms use data to generate rules and improve their performance over time. This ability to learn from data enables machines to perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so.","sidebar":"demoSidebars"}}}')}}]);
